# Scrambling_in_kicked_rotor_models

Here I solve the evolution of correlators that capture scrambling in the kicked-rotor model. The particular correlator here is the out-of-time-ordered correlator. For more details on the physics of the model see https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.086801
